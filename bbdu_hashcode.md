# Google's HashCode 2021's Virtual Hub at Babu Banarasi Das University

First, an introduction. HashCode is an annual coding competition where you have to solve a problem set by Google. There are 3 rounds:
1. Practice Round (anytime before Feb 25, 2021)
2. Qualification Round (Feb 25-26)
3. World Finals (April 24)

### Now, pay attention:
- The thing to remember about HashCode is, that it is a team-based competition, that is, you'll need a team to participate (Minimum 2 and Maximum 4 people in each team).
- Members of your team may be anyone that's enrolled at BBDU, or even outside students (seek approval from organizer first).
- You and your team members may choose to code in any programmming language of their choice like python3, C++, C, Java, Kotlin, Go, Rust, JS and many more.
- Performing well in HashCode can lead to many rewards, ranging from a certificate from Google, a t-shirt, a cash prize to even a job offer from the company.
- Thus, it's highly recommended to participate with maximum enthusiasm. If nothing else, you'll learn something from the other participants.
